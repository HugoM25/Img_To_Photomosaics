Hello ! Thank you for your attention to my program. Here I will explain how to make a photomosaic using this one.

First you have to use the program called "CreatDataSet.py". Beforehand it will be necessary to have counted the number of images of your grid by line and column.

For example, with our dataset_pokemon :
We'll have to write in the first console: 
dataset_pokemon.png
Then we are asked for the number of images (you have to leave a space between the two numbers):
28 18

A list will then be created (do not modify it). You can then start the second program called "ConvertToImg.py" and then just enter the dataset to use So here: 
dataset_pokemon.png
and then the image you want to convert :
bulb.png

Wait five seconds... and your image is converted!

The project is not in its final state, I will continue to improve it, don't hesitate to send me any problems!

Thanks!

PS : If variables are named emojis it's because the project was basically just for that but I wanted to extend it. I'll change them later.
