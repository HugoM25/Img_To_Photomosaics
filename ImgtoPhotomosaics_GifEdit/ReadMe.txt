Hello ! Thank you for your attention to my program. 
Here is a quick update of my photomosaic project, I added the possibility to convert GIFs !
 To use it, just use the same method as for a simple image. 

!!! Do not edit the folders called "doneFrames" and "extractedFrames" !!!

Open the program ConvertToGIF.y and perform the same steps as with an image by first making a dataset.


Just put your images in the folder called "DataToUse" and name them correctly.
Like meme0, meme1, etc.


Moreover, I have added a quick "tool" to create a dataset from a folder and independent files

.

I'll enhance all this later, it's still only in "early access"
